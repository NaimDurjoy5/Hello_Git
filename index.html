    <p style="text-align: right;font-weight:bold;font-size: 25px;"> My country name is bangladesh.<br>
        Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia. It shares borders with India to the west, north, and east, and
        with
        Myanmar (Burma) to the southeast. The country has a rich cultural heritage, a diverse population, and a complex
        <br>
        Here are some key aspects about Bangladesh:
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(244, 21, 21);background-color: rgb(54, 242, 47);font-size: 20px;"> Geography:Bangladesh has a
        primarily flat and fertile landscape dominated by the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. It is
        crisscrossed by numerous rivers and is prone to flooding. The country has a warm and humid climate, with
        distinct
        seasons of monsoon, summer, and winter.</p>
    <p class="p-color" style="font-size:large;">Population: With a population of over 160 million people, Bangladesh is the eighth-most
        populous country in the
        world. The capital and largest city is Dhaka, which is also one of the most densely populated cities globally.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-color" style="text-align: center;">Language and Religion: Bengali, also known as Bangla, is the official language of
        Bangladesh. Islam is the dominant
        religion, with approximately 90% of the population being Muslim. There are also significant Hindu, Buddhist, and
        Christian communities.</p>
    <p><b><em>History: Bangladesh gained independence in 1971 after a liberation war with Pakistan. The country was
                previously
                known as East Pakistan, and its struggle for autonomy led to a nine-month-long armed conflict and the
                creation of
                the independent nation of Bangladesh.</em></b> </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><i> Economy: Bangladesh has experienced significant economic growth in recent
                years, with agriculture, textiles,
                garments, and remittances being major contributors. It is known for its vibrant garment industry, being
                one of the
                largest exporters of clothing in the world. The country has made strides in poverty reduction and human
                development,
                but challenges like income inequality and infrastructure development persist.</i></strong></p>

    <p style="font-size: 30px;"><del><ins> Culture: Bengali culture is rich and diverse, with influences from various
                historical periods and neighboring
                regions. The country has produced renowned poets, writers, musicians, and artists. Traditional music,
                dance forms
                like the "Bangladeshi folk dance," and cultural festivals like Pohela Boishakh <span
